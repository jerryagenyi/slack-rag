## Core Business Model

1. **Recruit Volunteers**: SkillUp Life actively recruits individuals who are willing to volunteer their time and skills.

3. **Initial Onboarding and Management**: Once a match is made, SkillUp Life handles the initial onboarding of the volunteer. This includes processes like agreements and integration into the SkillUp Life system.

4. **Transition to Organization Engagement**: After the initial onboarding within SkillUp Life, the responsibility for directly engaging with and managing the volunteer on a day-to-day basis transitions to the requesting organization.
