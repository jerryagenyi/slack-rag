# Technical Specifications

This document outlines the technical specifications for the AI-Powered Slackbot project.

## System Architecture

The system consists of the following components:

1. **Slack Integration**: Connects to Slack API to monitor channels and post messages
2. **N8N Workflow Engine**: Orchestrates the entire process flow
3. **OpenAI Integration**: Provides AI capabilities for summarization and embeddings
4. **Supabase Database**: Stores raw data, summaries, and vector embeddings

## Component Details

### 1. Slack Integration

- **API Version**: Slack API v2
- **Authentication**: Bot tokens with OAuth 2.0
- **Required Scopes**:
  - `channels:history` - To read messages from channels
  - `channels:read` - To get information about channels
  - `chat:write` - To post messages to channels
  - `users:read` - To get information about users

### 2. N8N Workflow Engine

- **Version**: Latest stable (currently 1.0.0+)
- **Deployment**: Cloud-hosted or self-hosted
- **Required Nodes**:
  - Slack Trigger
  - Slack
  - OpenAI
  - Supabase
  - Function
  - Set
  - IF/Switch

### 3. OpenAI Integration

- **Models**:
  - `gpt-4o-mini` for summarization
  - `text-embedding-ada-002` for generating embeddings
- **API Version**: v1
- **Authentication**: API Key

### 4. Supabase Database

- **PostgreSQL Version**: 14+
- **Extensions**: pgvector
- **Tables**:
  - `daily_updates`: Stores raw updates and summaries
  - `documents`: Stores document chunks and embeddings
- **Vector Dimensions**: 1536 (for OpenAI embeddings)

## API Endpoints

### Slack API

- **Message History**: `https://slack.com/api/conversations.history`
- **Post Message**: `https://slack.com/api/chat.postMessage`
- **User Info**: `https://slack.com/api/users.info`

### OpenAI API

- **Completions**: `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`
- **Embeddings**: `https://api.openai.com/v1/embeddings`

### Supabase API

- **REST API**: `https://<project-id>.supabase.co/rest/v1/`
- **Authentication**: API Key

## Data Flow

1. Slack message is received via the Slack Trigger node
2. Message is filtered to check if it's from a team member
3. Message content is extracted and formatted
4. OpenAI generates a summary of the message
5. Raw message and summary are stored in Supabase
6. OpenAI generates embeddings for the message
7. Embeddings are stored in Supabase
8. Summary is posted to the designated Slack channel

## Security Considerations

- All API keys and tokens are stored securely in N8N credentials
- Environment variables are used for local development
- No sensitive information is stored in the codebase
- Supabase RLS (Row Level Security) is implemented for database tables

## Performance Considerations

- Batch processing for multiple updates
- Caching of frequently accessed data
- Optimized vector search with appropriate indexes
- Rate limiting for API calls

## Scalability

- The system can handle multiple Slack channels
- The database schema supports multiple teams and projects
- The workflow can be extended to include additional features

## Monitoring and Logging

- N8N provides execution logs for workflows
- Custom logging can be implemented in Function nodes
- Error handling is implemented at each step of the workflow

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with other messaging platforms (Microsoft Teams, Discord)
- Advanced NLP for better summarization
- Custom embedding models for domain-specific knowledge
- User interface for querying the knowledge base
