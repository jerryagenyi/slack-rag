# Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing strategy for the SkillUp Life Slackbot project.

## Testing Levels

### 1. Unit Testing

**Purpose**: Test individual components in isolation.

**Components to Test**:
- N8N workflow nodes
- Database queries
- OpenAI prompt templates

**Tools**:
- N8N built-in testing features
- SQL query testing in Supabase
- OpenAI Playground for prompt testing

### 2. Integration Testing

**Purpose**: Test the interaction between components.

**Integrations to Test**:
- Slack to N8N
- N8N to OpenAI
- N8N to Supabase
- Supabase pgvector functionality

**Tools**:
- N8N workflow execution logs
- Supabase database logs
- OpenAI API logs

### 3. End-to-End Testing

**Purpose**: Test the entire system from user input to final output.

**Scenarios to Test**:
- Daily update collection and storage
- Update summarization and posting
- Embedding generation and storage
- Query processing and response (future)

**Tools**:
- Manual testing in Slack
- N8N workflow execution
- Supabase database inspection

## Test Environments

### Development Environment

- Used for initial development and testing
- Separate Slack channel for testing (e.g., #test-daily-updates)
- Development database in Supabase
- Local or development N8N instance

### Production Environment

- Used for actual daily updates
- Production Slack channels
- Production database in Supabase
- Production N8N instance

## Test Data

### Sample Daily Updates

Create a set of sample daily updates with various formats and content to test the system's ability to handle different inputs.

Example:
```
**Today's Accomplishments**
- Completed user authentication flow
- Fixed 3 bugs in the dashboard
- Reviewed PR #42

**Challenges/Blockers**
- API integration issues
- Need access to test environment

**Tomorrow's Plan**
- Debug API integration
- Start implementing new feature
- Update documentation

**Resources/Links**
- PR: https://github.com/example/repo/pull/42
- Docs: https://docs.example.com
```

### Edge Cases

Test the system with edge cases such as:
- Very long updates
- Updates with special characters
- Updates with code snippets
- Updates with multiple links
- Updates missing certain sections
- Updates in different formats

## Test Procedures

### 1. Daily Update Collection Testing

1. Post a sample daily update in the test Slack channel
2. Verify that the update is captured by the collector workflow
3. Check the database to ensure the update is stored correctly
4. Verify that the user ID, timestamp, and content are accurate

### 2. Summarization Testing

1. Trigger the summarization workflow manually
2. Verify that the summary is generated correctly
3. Check that the summary captures the key points from the update
4. Verify that the summary is stored in the database
5. Confirm that the summary is posted to the designated Slack channel

### 3. Embedding Testing

1. Trigger the embedding workflow manually
2. Verify that embeddings are generated for the update and summary
3. Check that the embeddings are stored in the database
4. Test vector similarity search with sample queries

### 4. Error Handling Testing

1. Test with invalid inputs (e.g., malformed updates)
2. Simulate API failures (e.g., OpenAI API down)
3. Test database connection issues
4. Verify that the system handles errors gracefully
5. Check that error logs are generated

## Automated Testing

### N8N Workflow Testing

Use N8N's built-in testing features to automate workflow testing:

1. Create test workflows that simulate inputs
2. Use the Execute Workflow node to trigger workflows with test data
3. Use the IF node to verify outputs
4. Log test results for review

### Database Testing

Create SQL scripts to verify database integrity:

1. Check for missing data
2. Verify relationships between tables
3. Test vector similarity search functionality

## Performance Testing

### Metrics to Monitor

1. **Latency**:
   - Time to capture and store updates
   - Time to generate summaries
   - Time to generate embeddings
   - Time to respond to queries

2. **Throughput**:
   - Number of updates processed per day
   - Number of summaries generated per day
   - Number of queries processed per day

3. **Resource Usage**:
   - N8N CPU and memory usage
   - Supabase database size and query performance
   - OpenAI API token usage

### Load Testing

1. Simulate multiple team members posting updates simultaneously
2. Test with a large volume of historical updates
3. Measure system performance under load

## Test Reporting

Document test results in a structured format:

1. Test case ID
2. Test description
3. Expected result
4. Actual result
5. Pass/Fail status
6. Notes/Observations

## Continuous Testing

Implement a continuous testing approach:

1. Run basic tests after each workflow change
2. Conduct comprehensive testing before deploying to production
3. Perform regular health checks on the production system
4. Monitor system logs for unexpected behavior
